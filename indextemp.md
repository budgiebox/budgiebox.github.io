## What the fuck is budgiebox????

Budgiebox is a custom meteor addon for constantiam currently in development.

## The fuck does that mean?

basicly it means you drop it into your mods folder, along with meteor, and it runs.

**It's as Shrimple as That.**

Planned features for budgiebox include:

* Proximity voice chat for the server
* Constantiam specific fixes for inventory, placement, and other similar problems many Meteor users deal with
* Improved CA
* Improved rotations
* Improvements to discord integration
* Improvements to scaffold
* Printer Bypass

**How do I get budgiebox?**

You wait like everyone else until i decide its stable enough for release, at which point I will release it under this github group, both source and some compiled jar files.
